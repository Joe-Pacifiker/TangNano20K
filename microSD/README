This project will be built off of an existing project from WangXuan95.
It contains an SD card reader/writer example description I intend to fully comment and modify for future projects.

Once I can interface with external storage from the microSD card I can begin to work with colored images and videos!

10/7/2024:
 With careful research I have realized that my understanding of SDIO is incorrect.
 No microSD cards available or manufactured support SDIO communication protocol!
  They support 2 types of protocol:
  1) SD
  2) SPI
 The provided example uses SPI mode, I will cover this one first since it is readily available and working.
 After I have fully understood SPI communication I will transfer over to SD communication.

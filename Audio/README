Here is where audio projects will go.

I plan to emulate GBA audio for various titles like Kirby Nightmare in Dreamland

In order to do so I will need to master the I2S communication protocol.
Here are the pins associated with the DAC and Audio PA for the TangNano 20K:

Pin 51 -> PA_SDb/EN
Pin 56 -> I2S_BCLK
Pin 55 -> I2S_LRCK
Pin 54 -> I2S_DIN

Figure out how to interface to the speaker with the above physical constraints

An update as of 10/5/2024:
 The connector type for the pin header is the "JST 1.25mm pitch XH"
 I was unable to get any confirmation on this other than guess and check work on Amazon...

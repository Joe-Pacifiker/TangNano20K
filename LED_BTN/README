This project is the working example for the TangNano 20K FPGA.

Brief instructions for windows 11 installation:

1) Install Gowin IDE
2) Install Gowin Programmer Driver
3) Synthesize,Place & Route,Program board

A copy of the FPGA schematics will be included:
Pin 88 is Key Switch 1
Pin 15 is LED 0

When Key Switch 1 is pressed LED 0 is turned on (Active low)

There are two ways to program this FPGA:
1) SRAM (I don't prefer this since it requires power)
2) EEPROM (Retained even after power loss; Preferred)
